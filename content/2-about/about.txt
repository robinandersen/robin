About: 

Over the past 5 years I have envision how people experience a bunch of diffrent products made for a number of great clients. I strive to bring that vision to life in a way that feels inspired, refined and even magical.

Except designing I love going for a jog, photographing people, aritecture or nature around me. Also, i’m in the process of learing myself kitesurfing.
