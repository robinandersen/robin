About: 

Over the past 5 years I have envisioned how people experience a bunch of different products, made for a number of great clients. I strive to bring that vision to life in a way that feels inspired, refined and even magical.

When I’m not designing, I love going for a jog, photographing people, architecture or nature around me. Also, i’m in the process of learning how to kite surf.
