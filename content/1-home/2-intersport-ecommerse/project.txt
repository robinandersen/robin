Intro: 

Intersport is one of the world's biggest sports chains with about 5,500 stores spread across 44 countries. In Norway the chain is among the largest, with a market share of 12%. Although Intersport has about 100 stores in Norway  they had no online store until now. 

##My roll
I worked as a designer on this project. My main tasks were: Interface & experience design, prototyping and icon design. Everything from buttons, shopping lists, input fields, check boxes, campaign modules, product pages and the overall design system is made by me.

Project:

Making the product page easy to understand was one of the key pages we had to get right. There was a lot of different dependencies like color, size, is it a campaign?, is it new? and so on. All this had to stand out and at the same time fit well together to make it a breeze to buy the product.

Shopping cart sliding in from the right, giving the client two options. Continue shopping or go to the checkout.
