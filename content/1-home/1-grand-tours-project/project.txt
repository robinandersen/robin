Intro: 

In 2013, Keith Tuffley rode every kilometer of the three Grand Tours (Giro d’Italia, Tour de France and Vuelta a España) On the same date as the pros. Later, in 2015, Keith Tuffley, together with Alain Rumpf, wanted to share this experience with fellow passionate cyclists. They achieved this through offering their audience exclusive adventures such as: riding every Giro d’Italia stage for a week, hours before the pros, or climbing the Swiss Alps tighter with competent guides, vehicle backup and mechanical assistance throughout the trip. 

###My role
I worked on this project alongside with the amazing people at Jimmy Royal and Void. While working on this project, my key responsibilities were: website layouts, user interface & experience design explorations, illustrations, brand guide and marketing material.

###Tours
Each tour is presented on its own. We are quick to introduce what kind of tour this is, together with booking information, a heading and an image to quickly set the ground for the user.

###Stories
Grand Tours Project wanted to reach out to users with stories about their own trips and tours. To create a inspiring univers around their service.To meet this need, we made a design with big, beautiful images and easy to read paragraphs.

###Marks
Grand Tours Project offers four different types of Tours; Grand Tour, Grandfondo, Explorer and Randonée. They therefore needed each their name and mark to represent what was unique with precisely this kind of tour.

###It's all about the experience
We were lucky to have a lot of great imagery to work with. All images are taken from real tour experiences in 2013, when Keith did this project as both a personal challenge, but also to promote the cause of environmental sustainability through various initiatives along the route.
