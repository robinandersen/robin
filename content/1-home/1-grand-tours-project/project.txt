###Marks
Grand Tours Project offers four different types of Tours; Grand Tour, Grandfondo, Explorer and Randonée.  They therefore needed each their name and mark to represent what was unique with precisely this kind of tour.

We were lucky to have a lot of great imagery to work with, real tour experiences from 2013 when Keith did this project as both a personal challenge, but also to promote the cause of environmental sustainability through various initiatives along the route.
